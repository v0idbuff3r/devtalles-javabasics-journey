## Exercises
1. Use recursion to add all numbers from 1 to 10.
2. Use recursion to add all numbers from 5 to 10 (5+6+7+8+9+10). 
3. Create an example that demonstrates how to use recursion to create a countdown function.
4. Crate an example that uses a recursive method to calculate the factorial of 5.
- Factorial means multiplying a number by every number below it, down to 1. For example, the factorial of 5 is: 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120. By definition, 0! is also 1.
